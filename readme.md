# Poise in Motion

[**Live Demo**](https://momentchan.github.io/Poise-In-Motion/)

Poise in Motion is a real-time visual system that captures and visualizes the flow of movement across time, creating layered traces that overlap, shift, and dissolve â€” all rendered live in the browser.

## Overview
The system is built with React, Three.js, and a custom rendering pipeline using GLSL shaders.
It leverages a multi-pass rendering approach to blend motion history, generate bloom effects, and apply surface textures, producing visuals that continuously evolve with time and interaction.
